  <b>Sliding Window Pattern ::</b>
    => Sliding Window is an algorithmic technique used to process contiguous subarrays / substrings by maintaining 
  a window over the data and sliding it forward instead of recalculating from scratch.
    => It reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) in many problems.

 <b>Why Sliding Window is Needed :: </b>
    ❌ Brute Force
    For every subarray → calculate answer → O(n²) or O(n³)
    Example :: Find maximum sum of subarray of size k.
    arr = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]
    k = 3
    
    Analysis ::
    [2,1,5] → 8
    [1,5,1] → 7
    [5,1,3] → 9 ✅
    [1,3,2] → 6

    So here we are calculating sum again and again. and also some number is repeating in subarray. 
    TC = O(n^2)
    SC = O(1)

    So we can remove this problem by Sliding Window.
    
    ✅ Sliding Window
    Reuse previous computation → O(n)
    arr = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]
    k = 3
    max = Integer.MIN;
    sum = 8 ==> 2, 1, 5
    max = max(sum, max); => 8
    sum = sum + 1 - 2 
        = 7 ==> 1, 5, 1
    max = max(sum, max); => 8
    repeat this step unti we got maxsum
    So this process reduced TC from O(n^2) to O(n)
                            
    <b>Types of Sliding Window ::</b>
    <b>Type 1: Fixed Size Window :: </b>
      Window size = K (constant)
      📌 Use when:
      Window size is given
      Example: max sum of subarray of size k
  
    <b>Type 2: Variable Size Window :: </b>
      Window size changes dynamically
      📌 Use when:
      Condition based window
      Find smallest / longest subarray
      Array has positive numbers only
