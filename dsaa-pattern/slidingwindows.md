  <b<Sliding Window Pattern ::</b>
    => Sliding Window is an algorithmic technique used to process contiguous subarrays / substrings by maintaining 
  a window over the data and sliding it forward instead of recalculating from scratch.
    => It reduces time complexity from O(n²) to O(n) in many problems.

  <b>Why Sliding Window is Needed :: </b>
    ❌ Brute Force
    For every subarray → calculate answer → O(n²) or O(n³)
    
    ✅ Sliding Window
    Reuse previous computation → O(n)
